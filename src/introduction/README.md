# Introduction

OpenFare is a funding mechanism which is deployable with one commit.

The goal: fund the next million software content creators.

OpenFare can be used to fund open source or commercial software at any scale. It is a decentralized protocol which defines how payees can be paid.

With OpenFare, payments are managed programmatically. Payment plans and methods are defined in code. Which leads to the following advantages:

* Donations span the entire software dependency tree. Critical software which is outside the limelight is supported.

* Micropayment obligations for commercial software can be managed across thousands of software dependencies.
